New-York-High-School-SAT-stats
Guided projects about New York High School SAT score We've done quite a bit of investigation into relationships between demographics and SAT scores in this guided project. There's still quite a bit of analysis left to do, however. Here are some potential next steps: Determing wheter there's a correlation between class size and SAT scores Figuring out which neighborhoods have the best schools If we combine this information with a dataset containing property values, we could find the least expensive neighborhoods that have good schools. Investigating the differences between parent, teacher, and student responses to surveys. Assigning scores to schools based on sat_score and other attributes.
