In this project, you'll be working with Jupyter notebook, and analyzing data on movie review scores. By the end, you'll have a notebook that you can add to your portfolio or build on top of on your own. 

The dataset is stored in the fandango_score_comparison.csv file. It contains information on how major movie review services rated movies. The data originally came from FiveThirtyEight.
