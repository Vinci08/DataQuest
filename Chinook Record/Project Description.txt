Guided Project: Answering Business Questions using SQL

In this guided project we put our SQL joining skills to the test, using subqueries, multiple joins, set operations, aggregate functions and more.

In this guided project, we're going to practice using our SQL skills to answer business questions. In each step, we'll give you a task, and you'll need to:

Write a SQL query to extract the relevant data
Create plots where necessary to visualize the data
Write a short paragraph, drawing conclusions and explaining the data and/or visualizations.
